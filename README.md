## Schedule-It

This is the our CS 467 Capstone Project. Specifically, the project will create a useful and intuitive web and mobile application that allows Oregon State University professors to plan and schedule meetings with students that not only comply with FERPA regulations, but also both professors and students to attach documents or notes. It will improve upon existing scheduling technologies, such as Doodle and When2meet.
